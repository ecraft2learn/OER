<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Tilt sensor</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Tilt sensors allow you to detect orientation or inclination in two axes. They are&nbsp;usually made by a cavity of some sort (cylindrical is popular, although not always)&nbsp;and a conductive free mass inside, such as rolling ball. One end of the cavity has&nbsp;two conductive elements (poles). When the sensor is oriented so that that end is&nbsp;downwards, the mass rolls onto the poles and shorts them, acting as a switch&nbsp;throw.</h3>
