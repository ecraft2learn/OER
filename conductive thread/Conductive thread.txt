<h3 style="text-align: justify;">A little thicker than every day polyester or cotton thread, but still thin enough to&nbsp;be sewn by hand in medium-eye needles or with a sewing machine that can&nbsp;handle "heavy" thread.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Because it is strong and smooth, it is ideal for any&nbsp;wearable/e-textile project.&nbsp;Because it is made of stainless steel fibers, it will not&nbsp;oxidize: your projects will not "stop working" because of oxidation after a few&nbsp;months and its safe to wash.</h3>
