<h1>Sensors</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">An input device, module, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes&nbsp;in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently&nbsp;a&nbsp;computer processor. It makes a translation between the physical world to&nbsp;microcontrollers. A sensor is always used with other electronics, whether as simple as&nbsp;a light or as complex as a computer.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">There are digital or analogue sensors.&nbsp;The distinction between Analog and Digital is important when you are deciding which type of sensor you wish to use. Part of this decision depends on the type of resources&nbsp;available on your project.</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Analog sensors capture analog signals that can assume any value in a range. An&nbsp;interesting way to think about this is that an Analog Signal works like a tuner on an&nbsp;older radio. You can turn it up or down in a continuous motion. You can fine tune it by&nbsp;turning the knob ever so slightly.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">In order to successfully use an Analog sensor, you&nbsp;need some way to convert the data into a digital form.&nbsp;For example: this sound sensor&nbsp;is used to sense sound level, i.e., it&nbsp;translates the amplitude of the acoustic volume of&nbsp;the sound into an electrical voltage for sensing sound level. This process requires some&nbsp;circuitry, and utilizes&nbsp;microcontroller&nbsp;along with a microphone for creating&nbsp; an analog&nbsp;output signal.</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Digital sensors generate what is called a "Discrete Signal". This means that there is a&nbsp;range of values that the sensor can output, but the value must increase in steps. For example, consider a push button switch. This is one of the simplest forms of&nbsp;sensors. It has two discrete values. It is on, or it is off. Other "discrete" sensors might&nbsp;provide you with a binary value.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;digital sensor&nbsp;consists of majorly three components: sensor, cable, and&nbsp;transmitter.&nbsp;In digital sensors, the signal measured is directly converted into digital signal output inside the digital sensor itself. And this digital signal is transmitted&nbsp;through cable digitally. There are different types of digital sensors that overcome&nbsp;disadvantages of analog sensors.</h3>
