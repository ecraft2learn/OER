			<span style="position:absolute; top:421px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				The Ultimaker 2+ operates on 24 volts (Extra-low-voltage) and is therefore outside the scope of the low-voltage

				RISK OF BURNS
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:659px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				There is a potential risk of burns, as the print head can reach temperatures of up to 260°C and the heated bed can

			<span style="position:absolute; top:681px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				reach temperatures of up to 120°C. The nozzle of the print head is mostly surrounded by an aluminum cover to prevent 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:702px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">

			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:746px; left:132px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				Always let the printer cool down for at least 30 minutes before performing maintenance or modifications.

				The Ultimaker 2+ is designed to print with PLA and ABS filaments. The use of other materials is at your own risk.
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:876px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				When printing with ABS, small concentrations of Styrene vapor can be released. In some cases, this can cause

			<span style="position:absolute; top:897px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				headaches, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, malaise, difficulty in concentrating, and a feeling of intoxication. 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:919px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				Therefore good ventilation is required, and long term exposure should be avoided. It is advisable to use a fume hood

			<span style="position:absolute; top:941px; left:60px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				with active carbon filtering for ductless extraction. Fume extraction is mandatory for use in offices, classrooms, etc.
