			<span style="position:absolute; top:182px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				Although the heat of the heated bed already ensures the adhesion of your print to the glass plate, this is not always 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:204px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				enough. For even better adhesion, in some cases it is desired to use glue on the glass plate as well.
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:247px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:bold 16px ProximaNova">
				WHEN TO USE GLUE?
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:269px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				The use of glue depends on the material you are using and the size and shape of the model. 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:312px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				For ABS and CPE, we recommend always using glue, because these materials have more “warping”. This means that 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:334px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				the plastic will curl up. Warping basically happens because of the properties of the plastic. Plastics have the tendency to 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:356px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				shrink when cooling down fast (some plastics more than others), which could eventually lead to your print curling up at 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:377px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				the corners. Since ABS and CPE have a relatively big shrinkage, you will need glue to prevent it from warping.
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:421px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				PLA on the other hand, has a much lower shrinkage and thus less warping. Because of this, it’s often possible to print 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:442px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				PLA directly on the glass plate, without glue. In this case you need to make sure that the glass plate is completely free 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:464px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				from dust and oil though, because plastic won’t stick well to a greasy surface. There are however situations in which 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:486px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				glue on the glass plate is desired. If you want to print a model that has a big footprint, or with very thin parts at the 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:507px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				bottom it’s advised to use glue to prevent it from getting loose.
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:551px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:bold 16px ProximaNova">
				HOW TO USE?
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:572px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				The glue stick that was delivered with your Ultimaker 2+ can be used for the glass plate. To use glue, simply put a thin, 
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:594px; left:59px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				even layer on the glass plate. It is only necessary to apply glue to the print area.
			</span>
			<span style="position:absolute; top:637px; left:130px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				To better distribute the glue over the platform, you can use a damp cloth. This way a very thin layer of glue will

			<span style="position:absolute; top:659px; left:130px; color:#16294D; font:16px ProximaNova">
				be left on the glass plate.
