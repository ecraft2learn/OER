<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;passive infrared sensor&nbsp;(PIR sensor) is an electronic&nbsp;sensor&nbsp;that&nbsp;measures&nbsp;infrared&nbsp;(IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often&nbsp;used in PIR-based motion detectors.&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">All objects with a temperature above&nbsp;absolute zero&nbsp;emit&nbsp;heat&nbsp;energy in the form of&nbsp;radiation. Usually this radiation isn't visible to the&nbsp;human eye&nbsp;because it radiates at infrared&nbsp;wavelengths, but it can be detected by electronic devices designed for such a purpose.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The term&nbsp;passive&nbsp;in this instance refers to the fact that PIR devices do not generate or&nbsp;radiate energy for detection purposes. They work entirely by detecting infrared radiation&nbsp;emitted by or reflected from objects.</h3>
