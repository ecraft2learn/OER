<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Like all machines, your 3D printer will develop problems from time to time, perhaps producing poor print results or not working at all. When you are new to 3D printing, one of the main concerns is what to do if something goes wrong, how do you identify the problem and fix it so that your printer can be up and running again as quickly as possible?</p>
<p><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image003.png?raw=true" alt="" width="256" height="211" /></p>

<h2>Printer Setup</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>It is important that the printer is set-up correctly in order to have successful prints. This includes ensuring the machine is calibrated by levelling the bed, correctly inserting and replacing filament and updating the firmware.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Inserting filament </strong></p>
<p>1. Cut off and discard the first 5cm from the roll</p>
<p>2. Cut the end of the filament at an angle of approx 45&deg;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Straighten the first 20cm of the filament before guiding&nbsp;it into the feeder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Glass Plate </strong></p>
<p>1. Ensure glass plate is clean</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Apply glue only when required</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Ensure the safety sticker is facing up&nbsp;(there are different sides to the glass plate)</p>
<p>4. Always remove the glass plate when transporting&nbsp;your Ultimaker.</p>

<h2>Checking &amp; Aborting Prints</h2>

<p>Often if there is going to be a problem with the print, you will notice an issue in the fi rst layer. For example the material may not be sticking to the bed, it may be under extruding or not extruding at all, you may hear the feeder clicking etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>It is advisable therefore to watch (or periodically check) the fi rst layer of your design being printed wherever possible. Then if there is a problem with your print that becomes apparent in the fi rst layer, you can detect it immediately and abort the print. This limits both the time and material wasted on a poor print.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>You can see what a successful fi rst layer should look like with this visual reference from Ultimaker:</p>

If the printer is still warming&nbsp;up and the print has not started, simply turn the controller to&nbsp;highlight ABORT and click to abort the print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the print has been started, you need to abort through the&nbsp;TUNE menu. To do this simply turn the controller on the front of&nbsp;the printer until TUNE is highlighted and click to enter the TUNE&nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Atomic Method</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The Atomic Method can be used to unclog the nozzle of your Ultimaker. It will clear the blockage by pulling dirt or carbonised material out of the nozzle from the top side. To apply the Atomic Method you don&rsquo;t need need to disassemble the print head or hot end, which makes it very easy to use this method.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Tip: Besides using this method to unclog the nozzle, you can use the Atomic Method when switching to a material that requires a lower printing temperature. This way all residue from the previous material will be removed, helping to prevent blockages.</p>

<h3>Lubricating the Axis</h3>
<p><strong>X/Y AXES</strong></p>
<p>When you notice small ridges on the surfaces of your 3D printed objects or feel that the X and Y axes are dry it is advised to put a single drop of sewing machine oil onto the X and Y axes. This will help to keep your Ultimaker running smoothly. Sewing machine oil is not included in the Ultimaker 2+ package, but we highly recommend to only use this for lubricating the X and Y axes.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image018.png?raw=true" alt="" width="331" height="188" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>X/Y AXES</strong></p>
<p>Once every half year the Z trapezoidal leadscrew has to be lubricated with Magnalube. This is the green grease that was delivered with your Ultimaker. Make sure to spread 10 drops of grease over the entire threaded rod. With your next print the Ultimaker will lubricate the axis itself by moving up and down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Using the feeder in the right way and keeping it clean is important for a good extrusion.&nbsp; The feeder can be cleaned by blowing air on&nbsp; the knurled wheel or using a simple brush.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cleaning the Glass Plate</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>After a lot of printing, if using glue there might be too much excess glue stuck to the glass plate. This can cause an uneven print surface and it is therefore recommended to clean the glass plate once in awhile.</p>
<p>When doing this, always make sure that the Ultimaker 2+ is turned off and build plate has cooled down.</p>
<p>To clean the glass plate, take the following steps.</p>

<h3>Top Tips</h3>
In order to be sure about a successful next print it is recommended to re-level the build&nbsp;plate after having repositioned the glass plate.<br />Try using hairspray instead of glue for build plate adhesion. <strong>If using hairspray always&nbsp;</strong><strong>remove the glass plate before spraying to prevent future issues.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h2><strong>Common 3D Printing Problems</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<div>
<div>
<h3>1. Blocked nozzle or under extrusion</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image028.png?raw=true" alt="" width="440" height="241" /></p>
<p>After a long time of using your Ultimaker you might notice some signs of &ldquo;under extrusion&rdquo;. This means that your Ultimaker can&rsquo;t extrude enough plastic and is usually shown by very thin or missing layers in a print. There are several issues that can cause under extrusion however in most cases, it is caused by some dirt or carbonized material in the nozzle or another hot end part through which a (partial) blockage is created. When under extrusion appears it is recommended to use the Atomic Method in order to clean the nozzle and other hot end parts.</p>
<p>Step-By-Step Guide: <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/19510-how-to-apply-atomic-method"><strong>https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/19510-how-to-apply-atomic-method </strong></a></p>
<p>Video Guide: <a href="http://www.createeducation.com/help-support/videos-tutorials/"><strong>http://www.createeducation.com/help-support/videos-tutorials/</strong></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>Another issue that could cause under extrusion is that the filament is not being fed through the feeder freely. This could be because the filament is tangled on the reel, or it is a little too tightly coiled towards the end of a reel. Check the reel and if required untangle, unwind or try to straighten any tightly coiled filament.</div>
<div>
<div>

<h3>2. Print not sticking to the bed</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image030.png?raw=true" alt="" width="462" height="253" /></p>
<p>While using your Ultimaker it is necessary to periodically calibrate the build plate for good adhesion of the print to the build plate. If the distance between the nozzle and build plate is too big, the print will not stick properly to the glass plate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>To resolve this issue re level the build plate:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>It is also very important that your print bed is clean (glue is an exception of course) and free from oils from your fingers. If you&rsquo;ve touched your print bed a lot the oils from your fingers can prevent or make it harder for the plastic to stick properly, so try cleaning the glass plate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>To promote stickiness your machine was delivered with a stick of glue. Using glue is optional but tends to help quite a bit. Don&rsquo;t go crazy with the glue though, more is not better. Clean your glass plate and then spread a bit of the glue onto it. With a damp piece of paper or cloth spread the glue out over the bed and let it dry (starting a print that uses the heated bed will make it dry quickly). After the water evaporates you will be left with a very thin layer of glue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you&rsquo;re printing on a cold bed with blue painters tape, like on the Ultimaker Original, it is very helpful to wipe the tape down with some alcohol. The tape is covered with a waxy substance that can make it harder for the parts to stick. This isn&rsquo;t always needed but it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>3. Warping</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image032.png?raw=true" alt="" width="517" height="283" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Warping occurs due to material shrinkage whilst 3D printing, which causes the corners of the print to lift and detach from the build plate. When plastics are printed, they firstly expand slightly but contract as they cool down. If material contracts too much, this causes the print to bend up from the build plate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When your print is warping, make sure you have done the following:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Level the build plate correctly</li>
<li>Apply a thin layer of glue to the glass plate</li>
<li>Use the correct temperature settings</li>
<li>Use one of the default Cura profiles</li>
<li>Try adding a Brim in Cura</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h3>4. Caked Nozzle</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image034.png?raw=true" alt="" width="549" height="300" /><br /> The cause of a caked nozzle is usually that the print comes loose from the platform or that it never stuck in the first place. If the print detaches from the platform it can stick to the nozzle and prevent plastic from flowing correctly. This causes it to curl up and flow upwards along the side of the nozzle and block.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Preventing this is a matter of correct bed levelling and making sure that the part has good adhesion to the platform during the print. This can include using brim, cleaning the bed and/or adding glue and making sure that the platform has the correct temperature for the material you&rsquo;re using.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Removing the block of plastic isn&rsquo;t difficult but can require some patience and time. Let&rsquo;s say that the plastic in question is PLA, start by heating up the print head to ~100C and let the heat transfer into the plastic for a couple of minutes to soften it. If you&rsquo;re lucky you will now be able to remove the block of plastic in one go. At the very least you should be able to get rid of the worst of it. If the plastic won&rsquo;t budge, start increasing the temperature in increments until it starts to give in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If the plastic has spread around the two wires coming out of the heater block you should be careful not to pull on the wires too hard as you might break them. It&rsquo;s primarily the smaller of the two (the sensor) that can be a bit sensitive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If the plastic doesn&rsquo;t become soft enough to remove by just heating up the block you can add additional heat by using a heat gun on a low setting. Just be careful that you don&rsquo;t melt the fans.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>After you have removed most of the plastic you can heat the block up to printing temperature and simply wipe off most of the remaining plastic. It&rsquo;s not critical to remove every last trace of plastic but you don&rsquo;t want to have big blobs still stuck that can melt and then drip down on your following prints.</p>
</div>

<h3>5. Leaning Prints or shifted layers</h3>

<p>Prints start to lean or shift layers when a pulley becomes loose. The pulleys are connected to the axel&rsquo;s by a small grub screw, as these move constantly when printing they occasionally work loose over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To resolve this issue take a 2mm hex screwdriver&nbsp;and tighten all 12 grub screws that hold the pulleys&nbsp;in place very tightly, probably a bit tighter than you&nbsp;expect. The small allen key that came with your&nbsp;printer will flex as you tighten the screws.</p>

<h3>Top Tips</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to check how smooth the head runs manually on the gantry at this point. If&nbsp;there is any stiffness apply the unilube or some low viscosity oil and check the squareness of&nbsp;the axes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>6. X, Y, Z switch broken error message</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong><img id="img1" src="https://github.com/ecraft2learn/OER/blob/master/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide/3D%20Printing_Troubleshooting%20Guide_images/image041.png?raw=true" alt="" width="241" height="230" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>X or Y switch broken</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>This error occurs when either the X or Y limit switch is not activated while the print head is homing. There are a few possible reasons for this, therefore it is advised to check the points described below:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Check if the levers of both limit switches are physically pressed by moving the print head manually to the left back corner. If one of them is not activated, you could slightly bend the lever to ensure it is being pressed.</li>
<li>If the print head is not reaching the left back corner at all it probably means that there is a loose pulley. In this case, make sure that all pulleys (on the axes and X and Y motor) are tight.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Z-Switch broken or Z-switch stuck</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you get one of these errors it means that there is a problem with the Z limit switch. It either tells you that the Z limit switch can&rsquo;t be pressed or that something is preventing the lever of the switch from switching back. Both errors require the same checks and solution:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Check if nothing is blocking or pressing the Z limit switch for example filament under the switch. There might be something lying underneath the platform (preventing the platform from moving down completely) or there could be something stuck inside the hole in which the Z limit switch is located.</li>
<li>You can slightly bend the lever of the Z limit switch to ensure it is properly pressed and switches back without any problem.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
