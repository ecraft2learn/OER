<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>An&nbsp;analog&nbsp;signal is a kind of signal that is continuously variable, as opposed to having a&nbsp;limited number of steps along its range (called&nbsp;digital). A well-known example of&nbsp;analog vs. digital is that of clocks: analog being the type with pointers that slowly&nbsp;rotate around a circular scale, and digital being the type with decimal number displays.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong><br />The analog clock has no physical limit to how finely it can display the time, as its&nbsp;&ldquo;hands&rdquo; move in a smooth, pauseless fashion. The digital clock, on the other hand, cannot convey any unit of time different than what its display will allow for.</strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Analogue Signals for your project</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our world is analogue, with infinite values of, for example, sounds, or colour values.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With an Arduino board, you use the analogue pins to read spans of values from&nbsp;sensors, or the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) pins marked with a ~(tilde) symbol to&nbsp;control the current flow to a connected component.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a Raspberry Pi, there are no pure analogue input pins, and so two alternative&nbsp;options are made the scene. The 1st option is to use a specially designed A/D circuit&nbsp;chip (a Raspberry Pi &ldquo;hat&rdquo;). The 2nd option is to use an Arduino as an analogue sensor&nbsp;board, in conjunction with the Snap4Arduino software package.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When need for&nbsp;analogue output (indeed, pseudo-analogue output), the PWM option is a feasible&nbsp;solution using the Raspberry Pi unit as well, in a similar way as in case of Arduino.&nbsp;More specifically, special libraries add PWM functionality to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, is the option to use an Arduino as a pseudo-analogue pin board,&nbsp;assisted by the Snap4Arduino software package.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Digital Signals for your project</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital signals have a set span of values.<br />When you use an Arduino, digital signals are either On or Off - &lsquo;HIGH&rsquo; or &lsquo;LOW&rsquo; - 0V or&nbsp;5V/3.3V. On an Arduino board, there are 14 digital pins that can be used to write or&nbsp;read to and from electronic components.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a Raspberry Pi, there is a considerable number of digital inputs/outputs on its 40-pin connector that comply with 3.3V logic. More specifically, 3.3V logic levels means&nbsp;that the Raspberry Pi will interpret anything very close to zero volts as a logic &lsquo;0&rsquo; and&nbsp;anything higher than around 2V as a logic &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Applying higher voltage levels on these&nbsp;pins could damage the board. These pins can be programmed to intercept signals from&nbsp;digital input devices (sensors) or to control output devices (actuators).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A very interesting alternative is to use an Arduino board (plugged in a USB port of the&nbsp;Raspberry Pi unit) as an extension board for the Raspberry Pi that provides extra digital pins. Snap4Arduino tool offers the necessary visual programming command options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you create interactive projects, you need to take both the analogue and the digital world into account!</p>
